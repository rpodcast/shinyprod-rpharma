# Overview

Shiny empowers R users to create innovative web applications, without requiring substantial expertise in web development frameworks to get up and running. The positive impact of Shiny in data science workflows across academia and a variety of industries such as life sciences is well-known and growing by the year. It is quite common for an early prototype of a Shiny app to generate tremendous excitement for key stakeholders and decision makers, often leading to requests for enhancements and ultimately be included in a production pipeline or process. The road to meeting this goal is challenging, especially for data scientists and statisticians not accustomed to software development! This workshop is for the Shiny developer who has entered this stage of their application development journey. The user is ready to learn how essential workflows, best practices, and the expanding community of Shiny-related packages can help them climb the ladder of Shiny development.

## Setup & Configuration

Please view the information in the callouts below for step-by-step instructions on configuring your environments. While RStudio Cloud is the preferred development environment, you may utilize your local installation of R and RStudio if you prefer.

## RStudio Cloud

1. Join the RStudio Cloud Workspace dedicated to this workshop by visiting this [customized invitation URL]({{< var rstudio_cloud_workspace_url >}}). If you already have an RStudio Cloud account, you are welcome to use it for the workshop. Otherwise, you can create a new account for free.
1. You will see a project called *simclindata.shiny*. Open that project and create a saved copy. This process could take a couple of minutes depending on server load.
1. After the project loads, you will see messages in the R console about restoring or repairing the package library. Execute `renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)` to install packages into the project. This process should complete in one or two minutes.

## Local R & RStudio

If you prefer to use a local installation of R and RStudio, ensure you setup meets the following requirements:

* R version 4.1 or later
* Latest released version of RStudio, [`v2022.07.0-548` or later](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* The [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package. 
* Clone the Shiny application repository used in the workshop: https://github.com/rpodcast/simclindata.shiny 

:::

The example Shiny application used in the workshop utilizes SQLite databases. While a smaller (prototype) version of the database is included in the [application repository](application repository), the database file containing the entire set of records must be downloaded separately using the following instructions:

## Supplemental Database Download

1. Open the `{simclindata.shiny}` application project in your local RStudio session
1. Download the `synthea_covid19.sqlite` file using [this link](https://shinyprod-rpharma2022.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/synthea_covid19.sqlite) and save it to the `data-raw` directory of the project.
